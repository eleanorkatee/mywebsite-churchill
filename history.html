                <h3>Statement of Signifigance</h3>

                <br>

                <p>Churchill House is a good example of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style, (1960-), displaying several key features as follows:</p>


                <ul>
                    <li>Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.</li>
                    <li>Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and east wings.</li>

                </ul>

                <br>

                <p>In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style including: sloping structural fins, precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House is one of several Canberra examples of this style, and one of only two which display a restrained form reflecting, perhaps, a more conservative approach to the style because of the intended office use.</p>

                <p>The architecture of this building may contribute to the education of designers in their understanding of Late Twentieth-Century Architectural Styles.</p>

                <p>Churchill House has interest for its association with the prominent architect, Robin Boyd. The building was his last major commission.</p>

                <h3>History</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The building was officially opened on 14 April 1972. The cost of the works was about $1 million. Boyd died in 1971 before completion, and W K Williams was engaged by the Trust as its site representative to replace Boyd.</p>

                <p>Boyd was strongly influenced later in his career by the post-war concrete architecture produced in Japan (Taylor 1990:80). This Brutalist style is evident in the design for Menzies College Student Housing (1968) and in the design for Churchill House. In this latter phase, Boyd was seeking larger scale projects, although with only limited success.</p>

                <p>Churchill House is one of a number of Canberra buildings designed in the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style. These include:</p>

                <ul>

                    <li>National Gallery of Australia, 1971;</li>
                    <li>Cameron Offices, 1976;</li>
                    <li>Canberra School of Music, 1976; and </li>
                    <li>High Court of Australia, 1980.</li>
                </ul>

                <br>

                <p>Churchill House is an early example in this context, and one of only two examples of an office building. While Brutalism has been described as an ethic rather than an aesthetic (Banham 1966:10), both office buildings display a more restrained form compared to the other buildings, several of which were intended to portray a distinctive image in the national capital.</p>
